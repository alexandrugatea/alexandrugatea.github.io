**How to Create:**

- Once you load the webpage you'll see a grid canvas in the center of the screen, and a sidebar on the left
- The default grid size is 24 x 24 cells 
- The grid can be changed from the left sidebar, from 4x4 up to 48x48 cells, in increments of 4
>> If you change the grid size and hit **APPLY** it will remove your current drawing
- From *Background Color* section, you can change the background color of the canvas. Default is _transparent_, but you can pick White or Black.
- From Pencil Color choose the color you want to use for your drawing
- *Eraser* is the last option in color's list. Use it to reset a cell back to original state.
- **Toggle Guides** will show/hide grid lines on the canvas
>> NOTE that if the grid lines are visible when you download your image, they will be visible in the final png file 
- **CLEAR DRAWING** will completely empty your board
- Once you're happy with a drawing hit the **DOWNLOAD** button. The image will be saved to your computer with the filename "AG_Pixel_Avatar_[date], where date=YearMonthDayHourMinuteSecond
